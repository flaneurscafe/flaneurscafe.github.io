# Publishing standards

## References

Contrary to other web pages, here, we value academic standards. Therefore, your article needs to contain references correctly cited in the text. The preferred style is APA, but any other will do. To introduce references in the text, you can use the below example.

The citation is inserted in the text:
```
the French verb flâner, which itself is of Nordic origin [[1]](#refDefFlaner)
```

and the source appears in the reference list as

```
1. <a name="refDefFlaner">Définitions : flâner. (n.d.). In Dictionnaire De Français Larousse. Retrieved December 27, 2022, from [https://www.larousse.fr/dictionnaires/francais/flâner/34028](https://www.larousse.fr/dictionnaires/francais/flâner/34028)</a>
```

## Images

The images used in the publication need to have resolved copyrights, i.e., they cannot be used without the written permission of their authors (such permission needs to be attached to the article). Suppose an image is in the public domain or under a less restrictive license, such as a license from the Creative Common family. In the later case, this needs to be correctly addressed in the text.
