This web page emerged from an interest in an old art of flânerie – city exploration with a somewhat philosophical twist. The articles published here should be treated as a dive of the authors into the subject and are relatively short and easy to digest in their form. This assumption stems from the idea that the articles are more like loosely connected threads. It is easier to read them and write at our own pace than have a single long article that tries to explain the topic exhaustively. 

The published topics will span all aspects: city excursions, literature, and photography – a relatively modern addition or extension to the flânerie.

Currently, the only author is [*Budgie Perruche*](../authors/budgerigar-perruche/). Still, anyone can send their article for publication on the web page or become a regular contributor. More information on becoming a contributor can be found [*here*](../contribute/).
