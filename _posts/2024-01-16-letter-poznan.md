Motivated by my recent visit to the city of my birth, Poznań and the upcoming webinar about [*Réseau Art Nouveau Network*](https://www.artnouveau-net.eu/), which will be organized on the first of February 2024 by [*Museovirasto - Finnish Heritage Agency*](https://www.museovirasto.fi/en/), I wrote a letter to the officials of the city of Poznań, Poland. At the turn of the 19th and 20th centuries, the city experienced economic and urban development preceded by deluge destruction in 1888. It also was relieved from a stronghold status that blocked any development before.

The city has a number of art nouveau buildings, usually in rather deplorable condition, with exceptions.

In the letter, I informed the city about the recent revival of interest in Art Nouveau and also about the many steps the city could take in order to educate the rest of the world about its heritage as well as preserve it.

The letter is in Polish, but feel free to translate it via Google if you would like to understand my message better.

If someone attends the webinar and if by chance I will not be there, please let me know if someone from Poznań attended :-)

That is as little or as much of what I can do today. I can only hope it will reach the appropriate people. I will keep you posted about the eventual answer.
