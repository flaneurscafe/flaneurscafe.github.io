I was born in Poland not long before the Communist government was dismissed. I currently live in Côte d’Azur, France. Shortly before that, I was based in Haifa, which is one of my favorite cities – full of hidden gems that are hard to come by while visiting the city for a short period. Moreover, I have lived for a few years in the suburbs of Paris and have spent a short time in other cities around the world.

I plan to write here mainly about exploring the concept of flânerie, e.g., historical and social changes that led to differences in how we experience cities and, more importantly, strolling in the cities. I will also try to share some of my flâneries.

Please note that I am not a native English speaker and am not a writer by training, yet I am more than open to suggestions and corrections.
