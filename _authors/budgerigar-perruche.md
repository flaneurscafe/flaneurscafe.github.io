I was born in Poland not long before the fall of the Communist government. I currently live in Paris, France. Before that, I was based on the Côte d’Azur, and prior to that, in Haifa—one of my favorite cities, full of hidden gems that are easy to miss on a short visit.

I have also spent a few years living in the suburbs of Paris (before returning here a year ago) and have briefly stayed in other cities around the world.

Here, I plan to write mainly about exploring the concept of *flânerie*—the historical and social changes that have shaped the way we experience cities and, more importantly, the act of strolling through them. I will also share some of my own *flâneries*. Additionally, I will write about Art Nouveau, as well as art and architecture in general.

Please note that I am not a native English speaker and not a writer by training, but I welcome any suggestions and corrections.
